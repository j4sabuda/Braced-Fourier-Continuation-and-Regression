# Braced-Fourier-Continuation-and-Regression
Repository for the Braced Fourier Continuation and Regression (BFCR) algorithm, a novel and computationally efficient means of finding nonlinear regressions or trend lines in arbitrary 1-D data sets.

This repository currently contains 4 pieces of code:
1. BFCR; contains the BFCR algorithm
2. BFCR_precomputed_data; contains the precomputed data BFCR uses to work (this data can be replaced with the user's own precomputed FC data from chosen bracing data)
3. BFCR_internal_anomaly_detection; contains the BFCR internal anomaly detection algorithm
4. BFCR_edge_anomaly_detection; contains the BFCR edge anomaly detection algorithm
